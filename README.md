# TimerApp
**A simple stopwatch app built using Kotlin**

This is a simple stopwatch application developed using Android Studio and Kotlin. The app allows users to start, stop (pause), continue, and reset a timer. It uses a Handler and Runnable to update the time every second and displays the elapsed time in the format HH:MM:SS.
When the Stop button is pressed, the timer pauses and the button label changes to "Continue". Pressing it again resumes the timer from where it left off. The Reset button stops the timer and resets the display to 00:00:00.
